The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous mammal. It is the only
domesticated species in the family Felidae and is commonly referred to as the domestic cat or
house cat to distinguish it from the wild members of the family. Cats are commonly kept as
house pets but can also be farm cats or feral cats; the feral cat ranges freely and avoids human
contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and their ability to kill rodents.
About 60 cat breeds are recognized by various cat registries

<div class="content"> <h2>Taxonomy</h2>       

The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in 1758 for a domestic cat. Felis
catus domesticus was proposed by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777. Felis daemon
proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the Transcaucasus, later
identified as a domestic cat.

<h2>Characteristics</h2>
<h3>Size</h3>
The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the European wildcat. It averages
about 46 cm (18 in) in head-to-body length and 23-25 cm (9-10 in) in height, with about 30 cm
(12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.
<h3>Skeleton</h3>
Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic vertebrae (humans
have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most
mammals, but humans have five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans
have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an internal coccyx)
